## The Project ü§ñ

![Project](Project.jpg)

This project runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico H.
Comunicating with a server running on my phone using [Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/),
which then sends data to thingspeak to be displayed.

We had to use Automate because we were not able to get the GSM to communicate with thingspeak via GPRS so instead we used my phone as a server to recieve SMS messages and send http requests.
